correctly inputed the fields, press the sign up button where users will be taken to the login screen to login. The user can now authenticate themselves through their email and password. 

Once at the homepage users can see public posts made by other users. If ther user wants to record sound, press the microphone button in the bottom navigation and the users will then be taken to the recording screen. 

In the recording screen, users can start recording sound by pressing the green microphone button where time will start and button will turn red indicating that recording have started. To stop recording session press the red microphone button, where users will be taken to the save recording screen. 

In the save recording screen, users can replay the just recorded sound and loop it throught the loop icon next to the pause and play icon. Users can use the slider to hear the recording at a specifc point in time. Users will need to input a sound name and optioalally include a prompt. The user can then selet one of the three options to post and save, save, or retake throug the three button options. If users select to post and save the recording will be posted publically for other users to see in the home screen and saved privately in the library screen. If users select to save, it will only be saved in the user's library screen. The retake button will take users back to the recording screen to rerecord the sound. 

Through the bottom navigation, users can also select the library button at the bottom left where users can see all previously saved sound recordings.

### Differences to Deliverable 1 design

The main differences to deliverable 1 includes:

    - sign out button in profile page to allow users to sign out of the application.
    - like functionality have not been implemented.
    - there is now an appbar title for home screen and library screen remove empty space.
    - the loop button turn red when enabled.

### Devices used to develop and test application

The iphone 16 pro ios simulator were used for the majority of the development until recording function was developed. Permission
was permanatly denied to acces the microphone when tested. 

I then migrated to using the android pixex 9 simulator and chrome web to develop the recording functionality of the application.

### Extra information for the markers 

Extra information that markers may need:
    - ios simulator does not work for recording the sound.
    - when using the android simulator to test recording function ensure to turn on the "virtual microphone uses host audio input" in the devices settings. This will be through the horizontal three dots icons next to the device.
    - likes function have not yet been implemented and will not work.
